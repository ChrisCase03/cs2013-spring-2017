## Details

A deck of card is said to a priority scheme its ranks.  For example, a King has a higher priority than a Queen.  Similarly a Queen has a higher priority than a Jack and so on so forth.  Finally, a 2 has higher priority than an Ace.  Within a rank, the order of priority is Diamond, then Heart, then Club, then Spade.

Using the above information your homework is consisted of two parts:

1. Write a program that will generate a random deck of 52 cards.  The cards are arranged in random order.  Write a recursive program to determine the location of the highest priority card and the lowest priority card.  Your program must be recursive and that you can only have one search function.

2. Write a program that will print out all possible combinations for three randomly selected cards.  Repeat for four and five.

Your programs for above must be recursive and must use `generics`; however you can create own `Card` class.

3. Write a priority queue (from scratch) that will allow for you to insert and remove numbers (`Integer`) from a queue with the priority being defined as followed:

- An even number has higher priority than an odd number
- Multiples of `threes` has higher priority than other numbers
- A number with a lower numeric value of a number has higher priority
